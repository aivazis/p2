    Exception used to indicate that a constraint is violated

    Instead of being functions that return booleans, constraints throw exceptions when they are
    violated. This design choice is motivated by the observation that it is not always possible
    to handle a constraint violation locally, since the caller may not have enough information
    to handle the failure.
